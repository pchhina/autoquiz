# Launch quizme in from bash in interactive mode

- executable R script that can launch quizme from bash 
- since there is no direct way to force interactive mode in executable bash scripts, I use a workaround described [here](https://thesquareplanet.com/blog/interactive-r-scripts/)
- I also use aliases to rclone for syncing database with google cloud storage (can be commented if not needed)
